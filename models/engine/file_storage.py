    This module contains the base class { FileStorage } that anchors the methods that performs the CRUD {Create, Read, Update, Delete} operations in every model.
    Also, it serializes instances to a JSON file and deserializes JSON file to instances:

        __file_path: string - path to the JSON file (ex: file.json)
        __objects: dictionary - empty but will store all objects by <class name>.id (ex: to store a BaseModel object with id=12121212, the key will be BaseModel.12121212)
        Public instance methods:
        all(self): returns the dictionary __objects
        new(self, obj): sets in __objects the obj with key <obj class name>.id
        save(self): serializes __objects to the JSON file (path: __file_path)
        reload(self): deserializes the JSON file to __objects (only if the JSON file (__file_path) exists ; otherwise, do nothing. If the file doesnâ€™t exist, no exception should be raised)
